# Kong Workshop

This repository contains all of the necessary scripts and documentation for running an on-site or virtual workshop with a Kong Sales Engineer. In this workshop, we will create a fully functional zone inside a [multi-zone service mesh](https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/deployments/multi-zone/). The goal of this workshop will not only get users familiar interacting with a Kong Mesh multi-zone deployment, but will also demonstrate a minimum time to "Hello World" for a full stack microservice implementation. The zone will contain the necessary components for hosting services that support authentication, authorization, traffic routing, traffic control, observability and automatic failover across networks inside a servce mesh.
